# modelinginfectiousdiseases

This repository is dedicated to programs written for the book Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals authored by professors Keeling and Rohani (https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691116174/modeling-infectious-diseases-in-humans-and-animals). 

I have authored the Python scripts to run the models and offered them to the authors, who they kindly decided to add them to the supplementary material website (http://modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/). I was also keeping up-to-date on a personal website which does not exist anymore.

Given the current situation and the increased interest in zoonoses, transmission and infectious diseases, I decided to revamp the code and create this repository for public interest.

I have added the original Python 2 scripts to this repository and my plan is to upgrade them to Python 3 and add explanatory jupyter notebooks, so everything is more tidy up.
